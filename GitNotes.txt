Git notes
Tutorial with Dan -- 7-Jan-2012

Create a  new repository:
  in the directory with the file(s) you want to comit,
     git init

We just checked out branch 75d94622e2d2c4, and create a new branch called "retrospection":
     git checkout 75d94622e2d2c4
     git branch retrospection

We go into the new branch:
     git checkout retrospection

can do all 3 above commands in a single command:
     git checkout 75d94622e2d2c4 -b retrospection
