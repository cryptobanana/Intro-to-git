Git notes
Tutorial with Dan -- 7-Jan-2012

Create a  new repository:
  in the directory with the file(s) you want to comit,
     git init

Adding a file to the "staging area":
     git add GitNotes.txt

To commit staging area to a "commit object":
     git commit -m "commit msg"

To get status (to show what is in staging area -- i.e., what will be committed when type 'commit', and untracked changes):
     git status

Look at commit:
     git log -p
     (the 'p' shows the changes between current to previous commits)
