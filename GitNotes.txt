Git notes
Tutorial with Dan -- 7-Jan-2012

Create a  new repository:
  in the directory with the file(s) you want to commit,
     git init

Adding a file to the "staging area":
     git add GitNotes.txt

To commit staging area to a "commit object":
     git commit -m "commit msg"

To get status (to show what is in staging area -- i.e., what will be committed when type 'commit', and untracked changes):
     git status

Look at commit:
     git log -p
     (the 'p' shows the changes between current to previous commits)

to stage and commit in one command:
     git commit -am "this will stage and commit in one cmd"

to see differences between working directory and most recent commit (or staging, if it exists):
     git diff                    shows lines that are different (red: removed  green: added)
or
     git diff --color-words      shows only words that are different (red: removed  green: added)
(need to type 'q' to get out of pager for "diff" and "log" and other commands that use the pager)

We just checked out branch 75d94622e2d2c4, and create a new branch called "retrospection":
     git checkout 75d94622e2d2c4
     git branch retrospection

We go into the new branch:
     git checkout retrospection

can do all 3 above commands in a single command:
     git checkout 75d94622e2d2c4 -b retrospection
